## Taro meaning
Text for predictions was parsed from taro web-sites and then it was preprocessed. Also "normal" words were replaced by ironic (cringe) words just for fun
You can see this process here https://github.com/kkkchau/Taro_text/blob/main/taro_parser.ipynb

## How it works
Greeting and choosing category of prediction
